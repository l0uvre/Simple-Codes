## Dynamic Programming

### Concepts / Explanation
 * Dp is approximately recursion + memoization.
 * Dp is approximately careful brute force.
 * Dp is approximately subproblems + "reuse".

### 5 easy steps to dp.
  1. define subproblems.
  2. guess(part of solution).
  3. relate subproblem solutions.
  4. recursion plus memoization
           OR build DP table bottom-up
  5. solve original problem.
